# Training a Quantized GBDT for Network Intrusion Detection
These notebooks will guide you through the process of training a quantized Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) model tailored for network intrusion detection tasks. It illustrates how a quantized GBDT can achieve high accuracy in detecting network threats, leveraging the efficiency of quantization without compromising on model performance. Also, it will demonstrate how effect it is for hardware desigen.
